i don\u0026rsquo;t know) and sql server express not recognizing it. so i cleaned it up, deleted the cached files because i figured there was a error with one of the cab files or something, then tried reinstalling. this time, i got error code 2068119551, stating attempted\rto perform an unauthorized operation.\nfantastic. i don\u0026rsquo;t know what that means \u0026lt;3 at this point, i\u0026rsquo;m sweating whole cars out of my neck. i need this installed, and it\u0026rsquo;s hard to get ~250mib installed when you can only go at a max rate of ~1mb/s, fluctuating between that and less than 200kib/s. it\u0026rsquo;s after 11pm, i have to get up at 5am for work, and i have the following class day where, ideally, i should have this installed!!! i don\u0026rsquo;t know what i\u0026rsquo;m going to do.\nbut don\u0026rsquo;t worry, we\u0026rsquo;ve reached you about your car\u0026rsquo;s extended warranty finally, i try installing sql server 2019. i genetically cross-splice several toad genes together thinking this will save the day, and lo and behold, i is saved.\nhaha yes so what is the lesson we\u0026rsquo;ve learned today? i\u0026rsquo;ve learned that i still love postgresql, and that i\u0026rsquo;ve never in my life had such an unknown issue happen on a linux system in my years of administrating them. but on windows, i may as well just drop coins in a well and hope they come back up.\n","title":"Microsoft SQL Server Installation, or: Don't Install New Versions of Anything"},{"date":"2023-01-31","image":"","imageAlt":"","link":"https://ioerr.dev/posts/first-day-class/","summary":"First day was today.
