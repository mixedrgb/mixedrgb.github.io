      <description><![CDATA[<p>First day was today. Instructor was fantastic, though I feel bad because
I didn&rsquo;t really have any questions to ask. A lot of what was covered
I already knew about from my previous stints on and off the previous several
years futzing with programming, and reading in general trying to keep up with
what is out there. He did cover about two months worth of material in the
span of two and a half hours or so!</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s only going to get faster from here, and I&rsquo;m ready for it. I&rsquo;m ready
for a new change of pace. A new direction; somewhere that I can dive off from
and <em>know</em> that I&rsquo;ll get somewhere better instead of being stuck in a no-where
spot.</p>

<p>Alright, that&rsquo;s enough poking around.</p>
